As a kid, I fiddled with code to make my Neopets shop the prettiest and coolest of them all. And in high school I had the honor of redesigning the school's website which led to more website commissions from school clubs. Because I loved building web experiences I made the decision to study Computer Science in university so I could better understand the underworkings of programming and the web.</p>
                    <p>In my sophomore year at university I landed a position as a technical assistant for a new research center and a webmaster position for a small chemistry club, helping both groups build and maintain a new website. In my junior year I was hired as a web developer for the Daily Bruin and the student development group BuildUCLA design to build web pages and mobile applications. All these positions helped me build team experience, taught me a lot of valuable new skills while building on the old, and allowed me to share my passion for the web by teaching others.</p>
                    <p>After four years of late nights and tough competitions I graduated in 2015, and now I'm back home in the San Francisco Bay Area looking for more work designing and building awesome web experiences and continuing to learn more and more about the work I love so much.</p>

                    <h5>High School Reboot</h5>
                    <span class="first-letter">A</span><p class="first-p"><span class="caps">t the start of my junior year</span> in high school I was placed in Web Design for my vocational elective. Initially I was disappointed, I didn't get my first choice of Home Economics, and the class curriculum covered material I'd already learned. We spent first few weeks learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and I spent my days finishing book assignments early so I could busy myself with other work.</p>
                    <p>The class dragged on for those first few weeks until the class was ready to tackle a more creative assignment which was to build a website outlining our career goals. Finally, I had a chance to apply my knowledge beyond the scope of our workbooks. Given about a week to complete the job I researched new techniques that I'd always thought were cool but hadn't yet attempted like horizontal navigation and div alignments. I added pictures for each of the career fields I was interested in and threw in a contact form because I wanted to see how input fields worked.</p>
                    <p>It was the most fun I'd had in the class since it started and I was excited to have input from the teacher on my work. But instead of just giving me my grade my teacher saw that I was at a higher level than the rest of the class and offered me the opportunity to redesign the school's website for credit. I was thrilled at the prospect and the rest of my school year in the course was dedicated to revamping the school website to the best of my ability. My experience was significantly broadened on such a large scale project - I had to make use of stylesheets to reduce the amount of copy-pasting I needed to do, I dabbled into JavaScript for the first time, and really started to see how much more there was that I didn't know.</p>
